# Smart-Traffic-Management
Developed a machine learning-based traffic light control system  using YOLO and SSD for real-time vehicle detection and  classification. Optimized signal timings based on vehicle count.  Compared YOLOv8, YOLOv5, YOLOv3, and SSD on F1 score,  Precision, recall and inference time identified YOLOv8 as the  fastest and most efficient model.
